# Horiseon Code Refactor

Horiseon, a digital marketing company, has provided starting code that requires refactoring to make it more accessible according to accessibility standards by adding alt tags to images, which will aid screenreaders in providing accurate descriptions of the web page, and also optimize the site for search engines. Additionally, the semantics of the starter code will be updated and organized according to industry standards, so that it follows a logical path.


## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
